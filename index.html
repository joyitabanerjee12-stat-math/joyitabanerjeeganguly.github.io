        <h2>Hello! I am <strong>Joyita Banerjee Ganguly</strong></h2>
        <p>(she/her/hers)</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I am a third-year Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at <strong>Central Michigan University</strong>, 
        working under the supervision of Professor Debraj Chakrabarti.
    </p>

    <p>
        I earned my Bachelor's degree from <strong>Calcutta University, India</strong>, and my Master's degree 
        in Applied Mathematics from the <strong>University of Hyderabad, India</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My research focuses on several aspects of complex variables, with a particular emphasis on the 
        <strong>Fubini–Study metric</strong> and its applications, including computing volumes of positive definite Hermitian matrices.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am passionate about teaching, fostering student success, and creating inclusive learning environments.

    <p>I am a firm believer in the following principles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>
        <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>
        <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
        <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
    </ol>
